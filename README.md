# github-training-1
This is the repo for the first GitHub training exercise.


## Instructions for Storytime
In your pair, one person should be person a and the other person b. You should also have a team number. Do the following in the folder named `team-[your_team_number]`. If you are doing the training indepently, just use `team-1`:

1. Person a adds a sentence on line 5 of `storytime.txt` to try and progress the story to the finishing sentence on line 7.

2. Save, commit and push changes.

Once person a has pushed their sentence:

3. Person b pulls this and adds the next sentence to line 6.

4. Save, commit and push changes.

TIP: You can check to see if the GitHub repo has been updated by 'fetching'.

While the other person is writing their sentence, find an image you think represents the story and add this to your team folder. Don't forget to commit the new file and push.

**By the end, you should have two images in the folder and both of you should have contributed to the story in `storytime.txt`!**

### Instructions for Solo Storytime

You're Person a above - add your sentence to `storytime.txt` and find an image to add to the folder as well. Save commit and push both of these.
