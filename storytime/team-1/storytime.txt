Storytime!

Once there was fluffy sheep called Hamish who loved to tap-dance. 


His parents told him that his future was in highland dancing and that he would never succeed in his dream. 

Every night, when the other sheep had settled down to sleep, Hamish would sneak away to a quiet corner of the barn and put on his tap shoes.
